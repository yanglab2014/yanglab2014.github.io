<h2 id="Articles">Structures and signaling mechanisms of modular photoreceptors</h2>
<img src="figures/research_photoreceptor.png" height="300" align="top" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px;">
<p>
A superfamily of bilin-based photoreceptors use covalently-attached linear
tetrapyrroles (aka. bilins) as chromophores to perceive light signals from a
wide range of the visible spectrum spanning near UV to far-red. Upon absorbing
a photon, the bilin chromophore undergoes photo-isomerization, and triggers a
sequence of structural events that eventually generate a biological signal via
modulation of the enzymatic activity of an effector domain and/or downstream
protein-protein interactions. We investigate the structural basis for color
perception, signaling dynamics and signal integration in bilin-based modular
photoreceptors. We apply dynamic crystallography to capture light-induced
structural changes in photo-active crystals and dissect signaling-associated
motions via structural meta-analysis. Findings of this research offer a
structural framework for development and engineering of bio-inspired modular
light actuators with universal adaptability and color versatility that benefit
biomedical research and clinical applications.

<h2 id="Articles">Photoreceptors involved in photo-protection</h2>
<img src="figures/research_photoprotection.png" height="166" align="top" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px;">
<p>High-energy UV rays are extremely harmful to living organisms because they
cause direct damage to DNA, which leads to cell death and cancerous growth if
not repaired. Various photo-protection mechanisms are employed to prevent
and/or repair damages from UV irradiation in plants and bacteria. In plants,
UV-B photoreceptor UVR8 undergoes UVB-induced dimer dissociation that triggers
a host of cellular and organismic responses including light-dependent DNA
repair by photolyases. Our collaborative research in this area aims to
understand at the molecular level how a UV-B signal is perceived by UVR8 and
how UV-damaged DNAs are repaired by photolyases using biochemical and
biophysical approaches with an emphasis on dynamic crystallography.</p>
